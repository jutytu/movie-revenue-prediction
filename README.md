 ðŸŽ¬ Movie Revenue Analysis & Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project explores **movie revenue patterns** using data from [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).  
It includes three main stages:  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ understanding revenue distributions, budgets, genres, directors, and historical patterns.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering** â€“ handling missing values, correcting misreported entries, and constructing meaningful predictors.  
3. **Predictive Modeling** â€“ applying regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict movie revenues.  

The repository is organized to be reproducible and to showcase skills in **Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn**.

## ðŸ“Š Data Source
The data comes from **[The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)** on Kaggle.  
Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limitations, large CSV files (e.g., `credits.csv`, merged datasets) were split into smaller chunks using helper scripts in `src/utils.py`.

## ðŸ”Ž Key Steps & Findings
- **Data Exploration**  
  - Cleaned and corrected inconsistencies (e.g., missing budgets, mis-scaled revenues).  
  - Observed strong outliers in early cinema (e.g., *Gone with the Wind*, *Bambi*) impacting trends.  
  - Directors and budgets showed the largest correlation with revenue.  

- **Modeling**  
  - **Linear Regression** provided a baseline (RÂ² ~0.47).  
  - **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the best performance (RMSE ~0.96), capturing non-linear relationships effectively.  
  - **Gradient Boosting** performed slightly worse than Random Forest (RMSE ~1.07), likely due to feature limitations and overfitting tendencies.  

- **Feature Importance (Random Forest)**  
  1. Director average revenue  
  2. Budget  
  3. Release year  
  4. Genres (minor impact, though Action, War, and Drama stood out)
